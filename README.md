This project includes a React form component built with Next.js and styled using Material-UI. The form demonstrates basic input fields, validation, and handling of form submission with simulated asynchronous behavior.

## Features

- Dynamic form fields including text inputs, radio buttons, and a submission button.
- Client-side validation for email and age fields.
- Simulated asynchronous form submission with a loading indicator.
- Responsive layout built with Material-UI components.

## Getting Started
